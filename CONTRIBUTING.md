# How to Contribute

## Getting help

To ask questions about the Digi IoT web applications go to the 
[Digi Forum](https://www.digi.com/support/forum).


## Reporting a bug

The way to report bugs is to use the 
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/digidotcom/digi-iot-web-apps/issues).
Before reporting a bug, please read the following points:

1. Make sure that it is really a bug by checking the demo documentation.
2. If you still think you have found a bug, make sure someone has not already
reported it. See the list of 
[known issues](https://github.com/digidotcom/digi-iot-web-apps/issues).
3. If it has not been reported yet, create a new issue. Make sure to add enough 
detail so that the bug can be reproduced.

**Note**: The issue tracker is for bugs, not requests for help. Questions 
should be asked on the [Digi Forum](https://www.digi.com/support/forum) instead.


## Suggesting a new feature

1. Consult the demo documentation to ensure that the behavior you would like is
not excluded.
2. Make sure someone has not already requested it. See the list of 
[known issues](https://github.com/digidotcom/digi-iot-web-apps/issues).
3. Submit your request in the issue tracker.


## Contributing code

1. Fork the [Digi IoT Web Applications](https://github.com/digidotcom/digi-iot-web-apps) 
repository ([how to fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)).
2. Create a branch for your contribution. Use a name that defines the purpose of the additions/modifications. 
3. Make your changes following the code style used in the repository.
4. Submit a pull request ([how to create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#next-steps)).
A project developer will review your work and then merge your request into the
project, or come back to you with comments and/or questions.
