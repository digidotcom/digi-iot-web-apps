# Digi IoT Web Applications

This repository contains the source code of the web applications of the Digi IoT solution demos, which demonstrate the end-to-end connection technology using Digi products and services.

The web applications are built with the **Django** or **Next.js** frameworks and can be run locally. Those developed with Django use the [Python Device Cloud Library](https://github.com/digidotcom/python-devicecloud) to communicate with Digi Remote Manager and manage the devices set up for the demo.
